This repo is a framework for computer graphics rendering, which will first provide two models: 1. Easy OpenGL Rendering, keep in mide that do not over ceal opengl api; 2. as many as basic geometric shapes which are going to be objects, so that we can easily create a game like triangles fight rectangles. It will be fun.

I create this repo at the end of 2017, and I will continue to contribute this repo in 2018.
Great thought, ah... We will see.
